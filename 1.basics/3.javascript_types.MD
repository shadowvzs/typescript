## Types in javascript:
  * Primitives:
    * Boolean
    * Number
    * BigInt
    * String
    * Undefined
    * Null
    * Symbol
  * Reference types:
    * Array
    * Set
    * WeakSet
    * Object
    * Map
    * WeakMap
    * Function

* Notes:
  * Object vs Map
    * Map is an instance of object with many handy methods like: size, forEach, clear, set, has, get etc....
    * Objects only support string (number, boolean converted to string key), Symbol keys but Maps support every type (included primitives and reference types too)
    * Object is serializable with **JSON.stringify** into string form, Map cannot (it will be serialized to "{}" - which empty object)
    * Objects a lot better if we want access nested data *(myObj.key1.key2.key3)* unlike Map is redudant where you need use multiple time the *.get* method to achive same result
    * Object should have get/setter with custom logic or decorators unlike
    * Object is not iterable by default, Map has his own forEach function

  * Array vs Set
    * in Array the element could be **duplicated**, unlike in Set the elements must be **unique**
    * both is collection, however Array is indexed collection and Set is key based collection 
      * in Array we can access any element by index (arr[1]) unlike at Set you need loop over the set
      * Array support indexOf/findIndex until with Set we can use only *.has* which return boolean (like *includes* on Array)
      * at Array we can add where we insert the element with push/unshift/splice/using direct index, in Set we can use *.add* which add at end of the collection, also for array we can add multiple element but Set.add can add only 1 element
      * at Set when u remove an element then we must provide the actual value, at Array you must provide the index
    * We can change multiple element in array (ex. with splice) until Set offer semantic methods (add/delete/size etc) but more handy if we must change only 1 item
    
    * Note: often used trick to get an unique array is if we mix the array and set (*** const myUniqueArray = [...new Set(originalArray)]***)

  * Map vs WeakMap
    * A WeakMap accepts **only** objects as keys whereas a Map accepts to objects and primitive datatypes too
    * Objects in WeakMap can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it
    * WeakMap does not have *size, clear, keys, values, entries, forEach* methods (not iterable)

  * Set vs WeakSet
    * Objects in WeakSet can be garbage collected if there is no other reference to it
    * Sets can store any value but WeakSets can store only objects
    * WeakSet does not have *size, clear, keys, values, entries, forEach* methods (not iterable)
