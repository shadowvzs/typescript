## Classes

### What is an function in Javascript?
In JavaScript, functions are **first-class objects**, because they can have **properties** and **methods** just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that **functions can be called**. 
In brief, they are **Function objects**, so this object have various properties/methods like apply, bind, call, name, length, toString, **prototype (for inheritance, see below)**

IMPORTANT:
    One of most used property on Function object is **prototype**, which always have a **constructor** method property, which is our function itself, below we will understand why this is important.

Because of prototype chain, every method/property what is in prototype object, is directly callable ex:

```javascript
    function myMethod() {
        // do something
    }

    console.log(myMethod.prototype.constructor === myMethod.constructor); // true
    console.log(myMethod === myMethod.constructor);                       // true
```

**Note:** if you don't know why is true then please check the [article about the prototype/prototype chain/inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)



### History of OOP in javascript - Classes behind the scene
Javascript/Typescript isn't a real object oriented language, however since ES6 (ECMAScript 2015/ES2015) the class sugar syntax was introduced, but the javascript is still prototype-based language.

When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.

Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits on the top of a prototype chain.

While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model.

### Class comparasion - Typescript vs ES6 vs ES5 (and below)

* **IMPORTANT**: all 3 example below have exactly same result

```typescript
// Typescript class
class Vehicle {
    constructor(
        public make: string, 
        public model: string,
        public color: string,
        public year: number
    ) {
        // do nothing
    }
        
    public getName(): string {
        return this.make + " " + this.model;
    }
}

```

```typescript
// ES6 sugar syntax what we use now
class Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, color, year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        this.year = year;
    }
        
    getName() {
        return this.make + " " + this.model;
    }
}

```

```typescript
// ES5 - or the original form of our class, typescript will be transpiled to this
function Vehicle(make, model, color, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.year = year;
    this.getName = function () {
        return this.make + " " + this.model;
    }
}
```

Few note when you compare the 3 example:
* last example is the constructor itself for the instance
* in last example the **this** refer to instance which was created with new keyword 
    * this example work with both 3 code (Typescript, ES6, ES5): 
        ```typescript
            const vehicle = new Vehicle('bmw factory', 'X6', 'blue', 2019);
        ```
    * if you call directly the **Vehicle** function without new keyword then this will refer to window/global object
* ***protected, public, private*** exist in typescript, so it will warn you if you did something wrong however after transpiled to javacript everything is visible (***public***) even in typescript it was ***private*** but in javascript it is visible like any other property/method

### Let's dig deeper with typescript classes

```typescript
class Vehicle {
    public static counter: number = 0;

    protected _model: string;

    constructor(model: string) {
        this._model = model;
        Vehicle.counter++;
    }

    get model(): string {
        return this._model;
    }
}

interface ICar {
    color: string;
}

class Car extends Vehicle implements ICar {
    
    public color: string = '';
    
    constructor(model: string, color: string) {
        super(model);
        this.color = color;
    }
}

const myCar = new Car('BMW X6', 'blue');

console.log(myCar);

// Car { _model: 'BMW X6', color: 'blue' }
```

it is transpiled to

```javascript
// our first class
function Vehicle(model) {
    this._model = model;
    Vehicle.counter++;
}

// assign getter to prototype, so instance can access/use the getter
Object.defineProperty(Vehicle.prototype, "model", {
    get: function () {
        return this._model;
    },
    enumerable: false,
    configurable: true
});

// static property is on Vehicle itself and not on prototype, thats why it is shared between instances
Vehicle.counter = 0;

function Car(model, color) {
    // super object is called this way
    Vehicle.call(this, model);
    this.color = color;
}

// extends logic is here, when Car extends the Vehicle
Car.prototype = Object.create(Vehicle.prototype);
Car.prototype.constructor = Car;
```

### Try it yourself what happen with classes :)
well the above example is a shorter form, after transpile an class, it should have more boilerplate
